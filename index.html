            <div class="section-description">
                The web is made up of:
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>HTML which "glues" everything together</li>
                    <li>URLs</li>
                    <li>HTTP </li>
                    <li>Web Applications</li>
                </ul>
                <p> Hyperlinks serve as the glue holding together all pages of the web. Many types of files can be found on the web, including Plain Text, HTML, Images, Videos, and Music.</p>
                <p> There are <span class="italic"> 3 main pieces of Web- </span> Your Computer , Internet and Servers
                </p>
                <p>Your computer running a web browser (Internet Explorer or Google Chrome) and browser makes a request to to servers over internet which is the largeest computer network using <b>HTTP</b> protocol. Servers send the response to your computer through HTTP. HTTP <span class="italic">(HyperText Transfer Protocol) </span>is the protocol that helps in communicating between your computer and servers. The servers are also like computers but they are used for hosting the files that make up the web .

                    <p>HTML stands for <span class="italic">Hyper Text Markup Language.</span> It consists of Markup tags,Web Contents,Images and Videos and References to other documents called Hyperlinks.HTML documents are made up by HTML elements.HTML elements are written with start tag, end tag and the content between the start tag and end tag.

                        <li><b>Tags:</b> Tags modify content. Here are some examples:

                                <li>Bold &lt;b&gt; + content + &lt;/b&gt; </li>
                                <li>Italics &lt;em&gt; + content + &lt;/em&gt;</li>
                                <li>Links &lt;a href="value"&gt; + content + &lt;/a&gt;. Note that this uses "href."</li>
                                <li>Images &lt;img src="url" alt="text"&gt;+ content. Note that this uses "src."</li>
                                <li>Break &lt;br&gt; which ends lines</li>
                                <li>Paragraph &lt;p&gt; which makes text blocks</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Element:</b> Everything within a set of tags.</li>
                        <li><b>Attribute:</b> Property of an HTML Element.</li>

            <div class="section-title">Inline Vs Block Elements</div>
            <div class="section-description">
                <p>An <b>Inline element</b> does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary. </p>
                Examples of inline elements:
                <ul>
                    <li>&lt;br&gt;</li>
                    <li>&lt;span&gt;</li>
                    <li>&lt;img&gt;</li>
                </ul>
                A <b>Block-level element</b> always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can. Examples of block elements:
                <ul>
                    <li>&lt;div&gt;</li>
                    <li>&lt;h1-h6&gt;</li>
                    <li>&lt;form&gt;</li>
                    <li>&lt;p&gt;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The <b>&lt;div&gt; element </b>is a block-level element that is often used as a container for other HTML elements. The &lt;div&gt; element has no required attributes, but style and class are common. When used together with CSS, the &lt;div&gt; element can be used to style blocks of content:</p>

                    The <b>&lt;span&gt; element </b>is an inline element that is often used as a container for some text. The &lt;span&gt; element has no required attributes, but style and class are common. When used together with CSS, the &lt;span&gt; element can be used to style parts of the text</p>

                <p>The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on... In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...</p>

            <div class="section-description">
                <p>Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.
                </p>
                <p> <b>Avoiding Errors:</b> When programmers don't avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.</p>
                <p> <b>Consistency:</b> In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson div the same class and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetion, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.</p>

                    <div class="css-subdescription">
                        <p> CSS stands for <b>Cascading Style Sheets </b>and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements.
                            <br> This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same class name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.</p>
                        First, prep the document to make sure it will respond to the following changes:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Add DOCTYPE html to the top of the file</li>
                            <li>Add &lt;html&gt; directly below this tag</li>
                            <li>Add &lt;/html&gt; below the final tag in the file Indent the HTML structure within HTML tags</li>
                            <li>Add &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; below &lt;html&gt;</li>
                            <li>Add &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href=""&gt; and add the name of the CSS file after href</li>
                            <li>Add &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt; tag and move HTML structure within &lt;body&gt; tags</li>
                        </ul>
                        Then, you will write two files:
                        <ul>
                            <li>main.html</li>
                            <li>main.css</li>
